WORKSHOP: Scraping Twitter and Web Data Using R
=============

This github repository contains the materials and slides that I prepared for the 2-hour workshop on web scraping organized by the NYU Politics Data Lab on March 2013.

The .R files in the `code` folder offer four toy examples of how to collect and analyze Twitter data, and how to scrape tables and semi-structured html code from websites.
